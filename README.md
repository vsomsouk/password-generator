<h1>Password Generator</h1>

The main purpose of this assignment is to create a secured password for the user using JavaScript. The user will have options if they 
would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters. There is a requirement 
for the user to have at least 8 characters and no more less than 128 characters in their password. 

When the user selects "generate password" button, a window prompt will appear and ask what the user would like to include
in their secured password. Once the questions have been answered, their secured password will appear in the box.
